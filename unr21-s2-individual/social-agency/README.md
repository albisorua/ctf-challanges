The idea with this task was to track the location of Tecgir William. Also we were
given his e-mail and a hint about hangouts. I found and intersting tutorial on
[Medium](https://medium.com/week-in-osint/keeping-a-grip-on-googleids-506814ae098b) that indicated some hints about how to obtain the `data-person-id`.
After finding it we go to `google.com/maps/contrib/111076247952673225160` and get the Google Plus Code
for Cascada Lotrisor which was the answer for flag:
