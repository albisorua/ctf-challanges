The whole idea of the exercise was to look at the headers for the e-mail
and read the conversation. The code to encrypt and decrypt the flag was
in `base64` format and the `requirements.txt` the same. What you had to do
has to decrypt them and then decrpyt the flag from the `covered.mkv`.
The flag was:

```
UNR2xxxxxxxxxx
```
